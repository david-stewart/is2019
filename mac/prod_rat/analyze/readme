Steps to run here (/Users/djs232/is2019/mac/prod_rat/analyze):

1. Make folder emb_data with the response matrices from RCAS.
   Note that the matrices don't need (anymore) the TH1D* M matrices, because
   the prior in *T needs to be weighted. *M is later projected.

   As it stands, there is a lot of extra information in these files
   than is needed.

   Matices are for pi,K,p + antiparticles:
   emb_data:

   >> ls -1 emb_data:
        /K.root
        /Kn.root
        /TM.root
        /p.root
        /pbar.root
        /pi.root
        /pin.root

*. (independent step)
    Make track resolutions.
    ./tr_resolution
    note: prefer MT to TM matrices (MT are what are used to unfold) 
    >> ls tr_resultion

2. Make the data in ../data/

    phenix_pikp_data/
       to_tuples.cc 
       pip_STAR.root

    star_pip_data/
        phenix_to_tuples.cc
        piKp_phenix.root

*. (independent of the rest)
   Make plots with StarPhenix_piKp_comp
   >> ./StarPhenix_piKp_comp.sh
   >> ./plot_comp.cc 

3. Make ./fn_weight/fn_weight.root with:
    >> fn_weight.sh
      -> uses fn_weight.cc
      -> make fn_weight.root
    

3. Make the weighted matrices under ./weight_TM

    (a) weight_TM.sh
    -> driver for weight_TM.cc
        -> uses ../cc/inc_Tsallis.cc

    * can also use plot_weight_TM.cc
    To make a 3x2 matrix Measured x Truth matrices

4. -- to do -- the actual unfolding

    ./unfold
