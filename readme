This repository has been frozen so as to preserve its Initial Stages 2019 status

I will hereafter work on a new respository with better, and saner, github habits

Directory listing:


RunData/
   Make simple trees for analysis, using input from RunQA/

RunQA/
    Get run averaged values to make a bad_runs_list. 
    Also make TProfile's for each of the bbc(vz) for use in RunData/

RunQA_SL18b/  ->unfinished
    Same as above but for SL18b/ in theoryk

RunTree_206/    -> unfinished

TrackEmbedding/ -> old code. Needs to be refactored. Still used to get the embedding histograms.
    ./makeMatrices :: newer code, reads the tracked matched code in
    ./makeMatrices/input :: old input files for matching piKp+/-

TreeRoots/
    Current code. Makes trees of bbc[ES/EL/E/WS/WL/W] vz vzVpd ZDCx etc...
    Use to make EA definitions. (Probably replaces EA_metrics from above).

TreeRoots_SL18b/
    Same as TreeRoots/ but for st_physics (for 500206 and 500004 triggers)



mac/
    files meant only to be run on my local computer. Some use Root6 functionality.

rcas/
    analysis done on RCAS.

    This is differentiated from the other rcas folders because it is sub-analysis,
    using the output of other folders. Typically this is done because the initial
    output trees (such as for TreeRoots_SL18b) are very large, and it is more
    convenient to do further analysis on RCAS prior to moving to working on my mac.

    ./TreeRoots
    
arch/
    old stuff. Probably can delete
    EA_metrics/ -> archive?
       ? 

scripts/
    check.py :: many local copies of this exist. I probably won't use this again.




|1| [ ] compile all the RunQA results into:
    1. [ ] a list of runIds present
    2. [ ] TH1D of the results for each of the criteria
|2| [ ] make the bad run list
|3| [ ] run the EA_events script with the bad_run list
